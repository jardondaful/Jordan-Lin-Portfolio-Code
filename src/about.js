        <p>
          Welcome to my space on the web! I recently completed my B.S. in Computer Science & 
          Engineering, with a minor in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies, at UCLA. My professional
          experience includes roles at both Esri and UCLA, where I fulfilled four internships and part-time positions 
          in technical support and software/website development. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to apply my technical
          skill set in a variety of professional environments and am always eager to take on new challenges. Dive in to discover how I 
          blend analytical skills with technological artistry to navigate and shape the digital landscape!
