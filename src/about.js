        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my space on the web! I recently completed my B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering, 
          with a minor in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies, at UCLA. I'm currently working 
          as a Data Analyst I at Nichols Consulting Engineers in their Pavement Management Program. My previous 
          professional experience includes roles at Esri and UCLA, where I worked as a Software Development 
          Intern and Website Developer. <br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
          My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, Python, React, Angular, 
          and various GIS tools like ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine. I apply my skills to diverse 
          projects, from developing data analysis tools and automating processes to creating interactive 
          web applications and optimizing user interfaces. <br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences.
          Whether it's developing innovative software solutions, analyzing geospatial data, or optimizing 
          backend systems, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continue growing in this 
          ever-evolving field. <br /><br />
