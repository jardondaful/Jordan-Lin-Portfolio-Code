      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Welcome to my space on the web! I'm a Software Developer and GIS Analyst currently shaping the future of digital landscapes at Esri. My journey in technology is driven by a passion for enhancing user experiences and breathing new life into legacy systems.

At UCLA, where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering with a minor in Geospatial Information Systems and Technologies, I've immersed myself in a world where software meets geography. Whether it's modernizing flight-planning interfaces or optimizing bus routes around Los Angeles, my work sits at the exciting intersection of software development, UI/UX design, and GIS.

Dive into my portfolio to see how I blend creativity with technology to solve complex problems, or connect with me to explore how we can collaborate on future innovations!
